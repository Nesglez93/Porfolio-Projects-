Porfolio Projects 
This repository contains all of my SQL and Python projects related to data analysis. I created this repository to showcase my skills in data analysis and to share my work with others.

Projects
The projects in this repository are divided into two categories: SQL projects and Python projects.

SQL projects use the SQL programming language to query and analyze data.
Python projects use the Python programming language to perform data analysis tasks, such as data cleaning, data visualization, and machine learning.
